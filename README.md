# Cloud Classification Modelling

This repository contains a python notebook which constructs and evaluates a cloud classification model for Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. This project utilises K-means clustering to produce an initial image segmentation, and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to produce a supervised classification model.
